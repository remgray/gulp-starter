        <p style="font-style: italic;">Exercising Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights</p>
        <p>To exercise your access, data portability and/or deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable
          CA
          User
          request to us by either:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><a href="/ccpa-form.html">Clicking here</a></li>
          <li>Emailing us at: <a href="mailto:ask@insideout.com">ask@insideout.com</a>; or</li>
          <li>Sending us U.S. mail to: “Inside and Out”: 1526 Otto Blvd, Chicago Heights, IL 60411, United States.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your
          behalf,
          may
          make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.</p>
        <p>You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
          The
          verifiable CA User request must:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we
            collected
            personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
          <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond
            to
            it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
          or
          authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable CA
          User
          request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a
          verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Response Timing and Format</p>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt thereof.
          If
          we
          require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
          We
          will
          deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only
          cover
          the
          twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable request. The response we provide will also
          explain the
          reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
          to
          provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information
          from
          one
          entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is excessive,
          repetitive, or
          manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that
          decision
          and
          provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
