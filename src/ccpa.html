				<h3 class="title-sm">Your Rights and Choices</h3>
				<p>The CCPA provides CA Users (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</p>
				<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable CA User request, we will disclose to you:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>- The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
					<li>- The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
					<li>- Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
					<li>- The categories of third parties with whom we have shared that personal information.</li>
					<li>- The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Deletion</span></p>
				<p>Request Rights You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable CA User request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our (their) records, unless an exception applies; provided, however, that in some cases, strictly for regulatory compliance purposes and to better evidence/honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests (and for no other purposes), we may retain certain items of your personal information on a de-identified and aggregated basis in such a manner that the data no longer identifies you.</p>
				<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
				<ol class="list">
					<li>- Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our obligations in connection with our contract with you.</li>
					<li>- Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
					<li>- Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
					<li>- Exercise free speech rights, ensure the right of another CA User to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
					<li>- Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).</li>
					<li>- Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
					<li>- Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with CA User expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
					<li>- Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
					<li>- Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
				</ol>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">Exercising Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights</p>
				<p>To exercise your access, data portability and/or deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable CA User request to us by either:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>- Emailing us at: <a href="mailto:help@sunenergygold.com">help@sunenergygold.com</a>; or</li>
					<li>- Sending us U.S. mail to: “Sun Energy Gold”: 919 3rd Ave New York, New York(NY), 10022.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.</p>
				<p>You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable CA User request must:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
					<li>- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable CA User request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">Response Timing and Format</p>
				<p>We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt thereof. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
				<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
				<h3 class="title-sm">Non-Discrimination</h3>
				<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>- Deny you goods or services;</li>
					<li>- Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
					<li>- Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services; and/or</li>
					<li>- Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
				</ul>
